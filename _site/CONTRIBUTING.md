Please make sure your pull request/feature request takes into account the following contribution guidelines:

- This project is managed by volunteers, and it's important that we keep things as simple as possible and as easy to maintain as possible. When choosing between simplicity and complexity we will probably choose simplicity, even if the complex solution is more theoretically correct.
- Smaller pull requests (one for each feature) are likely to get merged more quickly than huge pull requests that bundle together multiple features.
- If you are in the `ruby_school/owners` team, feel free to commit simple changes directly to master. Examples of simple changes are translation fixes, typos etc. However, since changes to master get deployed live to `rubyschool.co` immediately, please open a pull request for any changes that you are unsure of or want feedback on.
